# Demo Fetcher
Hey !
So this is a small (I think… I believe, please I hope I will not divague to a 20 cpp file, 4 header file) project.

This is a demo fetcher that will check recursively from a folder to archive (almost) every type of demo/replay files known in the gaming industry.

It will find and archive :
 - Dem files :
   - Quake
   - Quake II
   - Half-Life
   - Half-Life²
 - lmp files :
   - Doom engine games/mods (like Hexen/Heretic)
 - Trackmania replay files (Gamebox engine [Gbx files])
 - Starcraft II replay files (SC2Replay)
 - Age of Empires II (and Definitive Edition)
 - Age of Empires IV (if suppported)

So it will be an extention listing in a dedicated file (extension.conf). The main purpose of this program is to help with speedrunning tracking (I may summon a python file to create a graph based on the leveltables recorded in the files [Time related to tries per level]).

This is for my demos and will help for creating graphs for my own website I am building to help with the statistics and tracking of my training sessions and marathons but if you think it would be helpful for you, feel free to fork this project for your use (because it's obviously nor finished yet, you won't be able to fork this now).
